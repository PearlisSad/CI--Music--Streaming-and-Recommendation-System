You will need the ```requirements.txt``` file listing pandas, matplotlib, streamlit, etc.
Open your terminal or a Jupyter cell and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Streamlit Dashboard

Run the streamlit ```file_name.py``` app and it will open automatically in your browser, displaying the plots.

```bash
streamlit run file_name.py
```
